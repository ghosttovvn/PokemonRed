# PokemonRed
Hello!! This is our text-based game!! The game uses the higher/lower mechanics of Top Trumps, placed inside the world of Pokemon Blue/Red/Yellow!
All text is taken from the game (so might be unnatural) and the storyline follows the story of Pokemon Red.

The functions are in almost reverse order, so they can call one another...

Future goals include:
- adding in the EXP system.
- items (currently buying potions and the Pokes system is pretty useless...) We want the player to be able to uses potions in battle and go to Pokemon Centers to heal
  this would involve passing the HP variable through
- multiple Pokemon and catching Pokemon...?
- More gyms and battles, of course!
- More descriptions of the routes and towns, whilst still being in the style of the games themselves.
